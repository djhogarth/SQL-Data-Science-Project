# SQL-Data-Science-Project

This is a data analytics project where I role-play as a data analyst who works for works for a non-profit organization that strives to improve educational outcomes for 
children and youth in the city of Chicago. My job is to analyze the census, crime, and school data for a given neighborhood or district. 

In this project, I identify potential causes that impact the enrollment, safety, health and environment ratings of schools by answering questions relating to a 
real world dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal.
